# Time Off

We treat all forms time off equally, regardless of reason, which includes vacations, sick leave, or holidays. This way there is no favoring of some holidays over others nor need to draw the line between weariness and illness.

Like many startups, we allow for an unlimited amount of time off. However unlike most, you are required to take two weeks (10 business days) of paid time off per year. We want you to work hard but also want you to recharge as much as needed â€” every person&#39;s limits are different but no one needs to burn out at work.

## Notice

As a good teammate, you should notify your team when you will be away. A good rule of thumb is days notice equal to the number of days you will be gone. For example, if a friend is coming to town and you want to be their host for the day, just a day&#39;s heads up is probably fine. If you will be gone for two weeks, let the team know two weeks in advance. Post in Slack and add mark the days in the team calendar.

## Federal Holidays

The only &quot;special&quot; treatment some days get are on federal holidays there will be no scheduled company meetings and advance notice for time off is not necessary. The list of federal holidays is currently:

- New Years&#39; Eve
- New Years&#39; Day
- Martin Luther King Jr Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving Day
- Day after Thanksgiving Day
- Christmas Eve
- Christmas Day

# Regular Work

There are no regular work hours where you have to be in the office. If your sleep cycle is wonky, as judged by a typical diurnal, let your team know and work things out!

## Working from Home

The only difference between working out of the office and working from home is one is at the office and one is at home. If you can be just as productive, location does not matter. Your team needs to remain productive too so give them heads up and plan meetings accordingly. Working from home is not a substitute for a sick day. If you are not feeling well, rest up!

## No Meeting Wednesdays

Our company does not have any regular scheduled events on Wednesdays to give at least once a week for everyone to focus on executing. This would be a great day to work from home for those that are productive in that environment.
